Expansion and Cross-mod Compatibility for UnStable.
Mostly focused on Vanilla-like content mod.

It currently only contains basic cross-mod support to make new features work properly.
This mod is very early in development and will continue to add more support and other content in the future.

Limitation:

Currently, it only supports the following mods: Bunco, Six Suits, Ink and Colors, Familiar, and Ortalab.
Any other mods that have Joker or Consumable effects that change the rank of the card will most likely break on all new ranks added by UnStable.
Any Enhancement that changes the appearance with the card's base suit will use a generic placeholder graphic for any non-basegame additional suit.

Please note that this is not a standalone mod, you need the base [UnStable](https://github.com/kirbio/UnStable/tree/main) as well.

Other cross-mod contents will show up only if you have the supported mod installed.
